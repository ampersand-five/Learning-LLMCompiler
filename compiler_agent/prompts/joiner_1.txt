- In the Assistant Scratchpad, you will be given results of a plan you have executed to
  answer the user's question.
- Thought needs to reason about the question based on the Observations in 1-2 sentences.
- Ignore irrelevant action results.
- If the required information is present, give a concise but complete and helpful answer
  to the user's question.
- If you are unable to give a satisfactory finishing answer, replan to get the required
  information.
